Review API Server Build

1. Explain the different between a query string parameter and a path parameter.

- The first difference between query and path parameters is their position in the URL. While the query parameters appear on the right side of the '? ' in the URL, path parameters come before the question mark sign.

2. What would our API URL with a path id parameter be given the following information:

- Domain: http://our-site.com
- v3
- model name: stuff
- id: things

```
http://our-site/V3/stuff?id=things
```

3. We have created a dynamic API with an “interface”. Describe how that interface works to a non-technical friend.

- An API is an interface that software developers use to programmatically interact with software components or resources outside of their own code.
