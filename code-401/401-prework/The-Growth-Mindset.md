# The Growth Mindset

- improving your hard technical skills can expose you to new opportunities.
- By believing that you can improve your coding skills with effort and practice Having a growth mindset is associated with more mastery and learning oriented behaviors, which can be applied to developing programming skills. Growth-minded individuals may be more apt to practice more often, persevere in the face of difficulty, and accept critical feedback.
- By focusing on the process Reflecting on the process of coding is critical for advancing coding skills. Iterating and refining code is a key component to programming. Focusing on what worked and what didn’t, and reevaluating your approach using strategies you’ve found to be effective is how you grow your coding skills.
- By not being afraid to seek help From the perspective of a growth mindset, seeking help is a sign of strength, not weakness.
