1. What is Role Based Access Control (RBAC)?

- RBAC is the idea of assigning system access to users based on their role within an organization. It improves overall security as it relates to compliance, confidentiality, privacy, and access management to resources and other sensitive data and systems.

2. Share some an example of RBAC including all possible CRUD operations and correlating roles.

- user can only read.
- Author: has access to publish their own posts
- Contributor: can write their own posts, but canâ€™t publish
- Editor: has access to publish and edit posts, including those of other users
- Administrator: has access to the administrative capabilities
- Super Admin: has all of the access of the other roles as well as site administration capabilities

3. What are the Benefits of RBAC?

- policy does not need to change/ update when a person with a role leaves the organizing. because policy is associated wirh role not with the person/user.
- when new employee comes we decide what role is appropriate for them and assign a role then they will have access rights to the resources
- Revisiting least privilege: this is very useful for damage containment in case if something happens you dont negatively impact resources.
