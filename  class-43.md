# Open-Source Software Contribution

Open source code is designed to be publicly accessible. anyone can see, modify, and distribute the code as they see fit. the source code must be made available, so that the receiving party will be able to improve or modify it.
By collaborating on accessible code, programmers have the ability to create communities of innovators who can make programs that we benefit from.
