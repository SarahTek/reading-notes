# Javascript

`Arrays` is a special type of variable . it is mostly used if you don't know how many items a list will contain.

`IF... ELSE` statement checks a condition.
```
if (score>=50){
  consol.log(You Pass);

}
else{
  console.log(try again);
}
```
`Switch Statement`: allow you to compare a value against possible outcomes and also prides a defaultoption if none match.
 

## **Truthy & Falsey Values**
 * `falsey` values are treated as if they are false.
* `truthy` values are treated as if they are true.

## **Loops**

* `For Loops`: is used to run a code for a specific number of time
* `While Loops`: if you don't know how many times the code will run you can use a `while loops`.
* `Do While`: very similar to while loops,except that a do...while loop is guaranteed to execute at least one time.
