# what is css?

css (Cascading style sheets) is used to style and layout web pages. for example;to change the font, size, color and space of the content.
CSS is a rule-based language â€” you define rules specifying groups of styles that should be applied to particular elements or groups of elements on your web page

There are three types of CSS which are 

 + Inline CSS - allows you to apply style rules to specific HTML elements.  
 +  Internal or Embedded CSS - used to define a style for a single HTML page
 +  External CSS - separate CSS file that can be added by creating a link within the head section of the HTML file.

## anatomy of CSS

+ selector - this defines the element to be styled
+ declaration - is used to set style properties and construct rules to apply to individual or groups of elements. the property and value are separated by a colon and the entire declaration must be terminated by a **semi-colon** and surrounded by curly braces.

 + border, the solid line that is just outside the padding.
 + margin, the space around the outside of the border.
