# Mango and Mangoose
difference between SQL and NOSQL

### SQL  

- Data uses schemas
- primarlyalled as Relational Databases (RDBMS)                            
-  table based databases
-  have predefined schema
- are vertically scalable
- scaled by increasing the horse-power of the hardware.


### NoSQL
- are primarily called as non-relational or distributed database.
- document based, key-value pairs, graph databases or wide-column stores.
- have dynamic schema for unstructured data.
- are horizontally scalable. 
- are scaled by increasing the databases servers in the pool of resources to reduce the load.




1. What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?
- table based databases
2. Give a real world example.
- represent data in form of tables which consists of n number of rows of data 
3. What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?
-  document based
4. Give a real world example.
-  key-value pairs, graph databases or wide-column stores.
5. Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?
- NoSQL database
6. Which type of database is best for scalability?
- SQL databases 



1. What does SQL stand for?
- structured Query Language
2. What is a relational database?
-  relational database is a type of database that stores and provides access to data points that are related to one another. 
3. What type of structure does a relational database work with?
- contains tables with rows and columns. 
4. What is a ‘schema’?
- A database schema is an abstract design that represents the storage of your data in a database.
5. What is a NoSQL database?
- NoSQL databases are primarily called as non-relational or distributed database.
6. How does it work?
- collection of key-value pair, documents, graph databases or wide-column stores which do not have standard schema definitions which it needs to adhered to
7. What is inside of a Mongo database?
- data stored as documents in JSON format.
8. Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.
-  MongoDB. because it is fast and scalable,and it is used to save unstructured data in a JSON format.
9. What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?
- it does not use structured query language and are not preferred for structured data.
