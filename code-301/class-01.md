  - Conceptually, components are like JavaScript functions. They accept arbitrary inputs (called “props”) and return React elements describing what should appear on the screen.

- What are the advantages of using component-based architecture?
  - Component-Based architecture reduces the cost of development and maintenance. It is reusable which means can be used to reusable components to spread the development and maintenance cost across several applications. It increases the reliability of the whole system via reuse.

  - props is short for properties
- How are props used in React?
  - Props are arguments passed into (its parent) React components. Props are passed to components via HTML attributes.
