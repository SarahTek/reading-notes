# What Do Computer Coders Do?

A computer coder, also called a computer programmer, designs, writes, and then tests code for computer software or mobile applications.


## What is a Text Editor?

The formal definition is: “A text editor is a type of program used for editing plain text files.A text editor is a piece of software that you download and install on
your computer, or you access online through your web browser, that
allows you to write and manage text, especially the text that you write
to build a web site. 

## What features should you look for in a text editor?
* syntax highlighting
  * determines the color and style of source code displayed in the Visual Studio Code editor.
  * allows code in posts to be highlighted based on the language it's written in, to make it easier to read
* code completion
  * A great feature of any text editing software is code completion. 
  * feature in some programming environments that speeds up the process of coding applications by reducing typos and other common mistakes.
* a nice variety of themes
  *  themes will allow you to change the color of the background of your text editor, the series of colors in your text, and sometimes themes will affect other   aspects of your text editing
software as well
  * reduce eye strain and fatigue
* Extentsion
  * provide some plugin mechanism, or is scriptable, so a programmer can customize the editor with additional features – this is more advanced
  
  
  ### Comparison of “Basic text editor" vs coding-specific text editor vs IDE.
  
  - A **Basic Text Editor** kind of gives away what it does in the title— *it edits text*. It also manages text, and manages files.
  - A **code specific Text Editor** is specifically meant to edit code.A text editor is a piece of software that you download and install on
your computer, or you access online through your web browser, that
allows you to write and manage text, especially the text that you write
to build a web site. 
  - An **IDE (Integrated Development Environment)** is really a suite ofdifferent software all coming together. An IDE is a text editor, a filemanager, a compiler, and a debugger all in one software package.
